## dim-wish-lists
Source files for wish lists for [DIM (Destiny Item manager)](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager).

This is a repository for generated DIM wish lists - for more on what they are and how to format them, go to [DIM's documentation](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/blob/master/docs/COMMUNITY_CURATIONS.md).

To integrate this into your DIM, simply go to settings, click the wish-list tab and enter [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClanGreymore/dim-wish-lists/main/PvP_Wishlist.txt) into the "supply a wish-list source" box. It'll update automatically as we make changes.

To request a weapon or make suggestions, contact me on Discord (GoogleAssistant#0001) or email ClanGreymore@gmail.com.
